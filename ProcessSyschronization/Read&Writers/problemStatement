Consider a situation where we have a file shared between many people.

If one of the people tries editing the file, no other person should be reading or writing at the same time, otherwise changes will not be visible to him/her.
However if some person is reading the file, then others may read it at the same time.
Precisely in OS we call this situation as the readers-writers problem

Problem parameters:

One set of data is shared among a number of processes
Once a writer is ready, it performs its write. Only one writer may write at a time
If a process is writing, no other process can read it
If at least one reader is reading, no other process can write
Readers may not write and only read
